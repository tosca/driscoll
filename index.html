                    <p>Serious injuries are an unfortunate, and frequent occurrence in our state due to the negligence of trucking companies, who travel on our roadways.

Drivers who are in violation of hours of service requirements of the Federal Regulations may be operating large semi trucks while imparied or fatigued.

                    <p>All of us are faced with the difficult decision to place our elderly loved ones in nursing homes as their needs require. We expect that nursing homes provide the care and support needed for our elderly family members when making this difficult decision. Unfortunately, oftentimes, nursing homes are understaffed, and their employees are improperly trained to provide the care needed for their elderly residents. Even with the legal oversight and regulations in place to protect the elderly in nursing homes, negligence and abuse and neglect cases of residents continues to occur on an all too frequent basis in our state.
                    </P>
                    <p>Elderly residents of nursing homes must be protected from the abuse and neglect that often occurs in nursing homes.  Attorney Driscoll has extensive experience in representing elderly patients and their families in lawsuits in personal injury and wrongful death actions against nursing homes, resulting from the abuse and neglect of elderly patients.
